***Can you still spoof in Pokemon Go 2022?***

Defeat Pokemon Jim 
 The second popular Pokemon GO hack is the ability to trick your way to defeat any team at Pokemon Gym. Three players are required to perform this hack. 
 
 First, you need to start the fight in a gym with three players. Next, you need to remove the first two players from the battle. After that, the player will have to rejoin. Player 1 will soon be eliminated and will join a new battle. After that, all players will end the game at the same time, leading to the defeat of Pokemon in the gym. 
 This method is an effective way to overcome the most difficult enemies in GO. Still, it violates the Terms of Service and may be banned (as with most hacks).

Leveled up Pokemon GO hack 
 Level-up hacks are classic hacks used by many players to quickly level up characters and Pokemon. To do this, you need to catch the tracks of weak Pokemon such as caterpies, poppo, and beedles. 
 
 Next, you need to get double XP in 30 minutes using Lucky Eggs. After use, you can level up and evolve as many caterpies, poppos, and beedles as  you can to maximize your experience  and improve your character. 
 
 This technique is useful for new players who are just starting the game and can be leveled up quickly with minimal effort. It's still used by experienced players, but not so much. If you do this hack correctly, you can achieve over 80 evolutions in 30 minutes and maximize XP.
